Starting date 12.02

12.02:
- I watched webinars from Dare IT: 
    - "No bullshit recruitment - how to speak with a recruiter?"
    - "Compassion - is it a good way to cope with Impostor Syndrome?"
- I decided to create this repository as a form of diary focusing on my
    efforts during my work path
